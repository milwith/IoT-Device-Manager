# IoT-Device-Manager

This project is a lightweight Java-based REST API built using **core Java** (no frameworks) to manage IoT devices. It supports basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for IoT devices using an **in-memory data store**. The application uses `HttpServer` from the Java standard library and includes unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.
